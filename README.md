# SimplestAgent - Minimalist AI Agent Framework

A lightweight, configurable state machine for building LLM-powered agents with minimal code and dependencies.

"Generate Your Own AI Agent with just a Single Sentence"  

This is not just clickbait. It‚Äôs possible as at its core, an agent really is this simple.

A loop, a state machine, and some external preset functions. That‚Äôs the entire structure of our framework. If you‚Äôve ever called an LLM API, you can easily understand what our source code does.   

Quick Start Guide: 
1. Drop `agent.py`, `agent_config.toml`, and `run_agent.py` into Claude's project knowledge.  
2. For better results, also upload `SimplestAgent_documentation.md` and paste the content of "Project Instructions" into Claude's project instructions.  
3. Go to the chat window and tell Claude what agent you want to build.  
4. Download the generated Python files, follow the AI‚Äôs instructions, and run it‚Äîyour agent is now up and running.

We‚Äôve tested this‚ÄîClaude Project can generate an AI agent with just one sentence. It should also work if you upload the files to Cursor and call Claude, or use Cline/Roo-Cline. 

(However, ChatGPT Canvas won‚Äôt work!)

## üåü Key Features

- **TOML-based configuration**: Define states, prompts, and transitions declaratively
- **Single-loop architecture**: One LLM call per iteration
- **Action dispatching**: Register custom functions the LLM can invoke
- **OpenRouter API integration**: Use any model from OpenRouter's marketplace
- **Multi-model support**: Use different models for different agent states
- **Dev mode**: Built-in logging for debugging and development

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install openai python-dotenv requests tomli tomli-w
```

### Setup

Create a `.env` file:
```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from agent import AIAgent

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Get the API key
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")

# Create the agent
agent = AIAgent("agent_config.toml", api_key=api_key)

# Register actions
agent.register_action("search", search_function)

# Start the agent with an initial message
agent.run("Hello, I need some help.")
```

## üß© Core Concepts

### State Machine

The agent operates as a finite state machine:
- Each **state** has its own prompt, temperature, and model
- **Transitions** define how the agent moves between states
- Each state can specify whether user input is required

### JSON Protocol

The LLM communicates with the agent using a standardized JSON format:

```json
{
  "action": "action_name",          // The action to take (or "none")
  "action_params": {                // Parameters for the action
    "param1": "value1"
  },
  "message": "Message to the user", // Text shown to the user
  "next_state": "next_state_name",  // The state to transition to
  "require_input": "1"              // Whether to wait for user input
}
```

### Configuration (TOML)

```toml
# Agent configuration
initial_state = "greeting"

[description]
role = """You are an AI assistant..."""

[states.greeting]
prompt = """Respond to the user's greeting..."""
temperature = 0.7
model = "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
transitions = ["awaiting_task"]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Actions

```python
def search_function(params):
    """Search for information on the web."""
    query = params.get("query", "")
    # Implementation...
    return "Formatted search results"
```

Check the documentation for the complete configurations.

## ‚úÖ Roadmap

- [ ] Add personalized knowledgebase search capabilities
- [ ] Add output parser to mitigate reliance on models' ability to generate correct JSON output
- [ ] Implement memory persistence across sessions
- [ ] Add conversation history management tools
- [ ] Support streaming responses from the LLM

This project aims to provide a simpler alternative to complex agent frameworks while maintaining flexibility and power. It was built with the philosophy that AI agent development should be accessible to everyone.
